Title: Wider Church Division
---

The &ldquo;Bylaws&rdquo; of the Northeast Association (in Section 8.7) describe the work of the Division as follows:

> The Division on Wider Church Ministries encourages and equips Local Churches for ministries beyond their local congregations by providing resources and training related to the relationship of the Local Church to the wider Church [sic], including mission, evangelism, social justice, global partnerships, scholarships for wider church opportunities, and interpretation of Our Churchâ€™s Wider Mission support.

In the last couple of years the Division has worked on creating a grant request process, and then distributing grants, for funds in Association churches in three areas:

- Program and event funding
- New directions in mission
- Discernment and assessment tools.

In addition, we planned and organized the 2016 fall clergy retreat at Moon Beach.
