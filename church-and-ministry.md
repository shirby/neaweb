Per the Constitution and Bylaws of the United Church of Christ, Associations are responsible for authorization
for ministy, granting of standing in the UCC to congregations, and care of pastors and churches. In the Wisconsin
Northeast Association, these responsibilities are tended to by the Division of Church and Ministry through its
standing committees.
