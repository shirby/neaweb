## 2017 Camp Scholarships![UCCI Logo]({{site.url}}/neaweb/assets/images/ucci-logo.jpg)

The Division of Local Church Ministries provides automatic scholarships for &hellip;

* camping and youth faith formation programs at [Moon Beach or Pilgrim Center](http://ucci.org)
* national and regional youth events
* [Lay Academy](http://www.wcucc.org/programs-education/lay-academy/) courses.

&hellip; to members of all UCC churches in the Association.

Youth and family camp scholarships are awarded automatically upon registering for camp at either Pilgrim Center or Moon Beach. Attendees at half-week youth camps are awarded $50, while full-week youth camp awards are $100. Families registering for family camp receive $45 for half-week events, and $150 for a full week of camp. If a family does not require a scholarship, it can be declined at the time of registration, to preserve the funds for other youth. We also support Faith Formation Retreats presented by the Conference for NEA youth through automatic scholarships of $50 per student.

Scholarships applied to the registration costs for teens attending UCC Youth Events (i.e. Regional and National Youth Events, and Youth Trip to General Synod) are also available, upon application. Scholarship amounts for these events vary.

Local Church Ministries also encourages the faith growth of adults attending Lay Academy. These adults receive an automatic $100 per-year stipend for tuition, room, and board.

These people have requested that the Division of Church and Ministry list their names as potential pulpit supply speakers. The Division provides this basic information as a service to our congregations. Please contact these people directly to learn more about their interests in preaching and their backgrounds. Pastors who are ordained may officiate at communion or baptism during your worship service.

## Policy on Transfer of Ministerial Standing

\[The policy linked on the SEA site appears to be (by its title) limited to the Association. Is here a corresponding policy for the NEA? Are there other policies on ministerial authorization and standing maintained by the NEA DCM that should be posted/linked on the NEA Website?\]
