## Purposes

The Association is part of the Wisconsin Conference of the United Church of Christ and exists in a covenantal relationship with it as well as with the national setting of the United Church of Christ and local churches.

The mission of the Association is to:

-   Promote Christian fellowship among its members

-   Provide leadership, training, and support for shared ministries of its local churches

-   Express concern for the welfare of local churches, their ministers, and members

-   Help those in difficult situations.

### Authorization for Ministry and Standing of Local Churches

In the United Church of Christ, these responsibilities are vested in Associations. The Northeast Association Committee on Ministry \[link to description of COM\], authorizes, oversees, and supports our pastors, churches, and commissioned ministers.

### Current Priorities

These are described in our current [Vision of Ministry](about:blank)
