The Association is part of the Wisconsin Conference of the United Church of Christ and exists in a covenantal relationship with it as well as with the national setting of the United Church of Christ and local churches.

The mission of the Association is to:

-   Promote Christian fellowship among its members

-   Provide leadership, training, and support for shared ministries of its local churches

-   Express concern for the welfare of local churches, their ministers, and members

-   Help those in difficult situations.

## Authorization for Ministry and Standing of Local Churches

In the United Church of Christ, these responsibilities are vested in Associations. The Northeast Association [Division of Church and Ministry](/northeast/what-we-do/church-and-ministry/), authorizes, oversees, and supports our pastors, churches, and commissioned ministers.

## Current Priorities

These are described in our current [Vision of Ministry](/northeast/what-we-do/2017-vision-of-ministry/)
