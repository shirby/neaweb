The Northeast Association Executive Committee, which the "Bylaws" identify as the "Board," is the governing body of the Association, tending to the work of the Association between times the members gather in meeting. This committee coordinates the work of the Association and its Divisions, appoints leadership to fill vacancies between annual meetings, assists in preparing an annual budget, engages in long-range planning, and attends to other business as needed.

Members of the Executive Committee are the four officers of the Association, the chairs of the three Divisions, the Association's four members on the Conference Board of Directors, and four at-large members elected by the Association.

The Executive Committee meets about four times a year.
